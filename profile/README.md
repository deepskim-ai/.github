# 🕳️ Deepskim.ai

> **Surface insights no one else can see.**  
> An AI-powered research tool that mines the internet’s long tail — overlooked forums, preprints, GitHub wikis, and obscure blogs — to extract niche, contrarian, or underexplored knowledge.

## 🧠 What is Deepskim.ai?

Mainstream LLMs are trained on sanitized, popular, and SEO-optimized content.  
But **real breakthroughs often come from the edges** — small communities, ignored PDFs, unindexed threads, and weird blogs.

**Deepskim.ai** is a smart retrieval-augmented system that:
- Scrapes obscure, long-tail sources from the web
- Embeds and indexes them into a vector store
- Uses LLMs to generate summaries, patterns, and fresh insights
- Surfaces results with full context and citations

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

| Query | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| “What are underexplored markets in climate tech?” | Finds 3 obscure preprints + Reddit debates on algae-based soil carbon |
| “How are people using VR for unexpected purposes?” | Surfaces personal blog on VR phobia treatment + DIY meditation rig |
| “What are emerging problems in rural fintech?” | Pulls insights from low-engagement community bank forums |

## 🛠️ Running Locally (MVP)

> ⚠️ You’ll need Python 3.10+, OpenAI API key, and optional Pinecone key.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepskim.ai.git
cd deepskim.ai

# Create virtual env
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your OpenAI API key to .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" >> .env

# Run app
python app.py
```

## 💡 Why Build This?

Because GPT can’t give you what it hasn’t seen.
Deepskim.ai gives thinkers, researchers, and builders a window into the information **everyone else overlooks**.
